# App Generator

 A developer can get a Full-Stack app in many ways: using the [app generator](https://appseed.us/app-generator), check the latest starters from our official [Github repo](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/appseed/blob/master/README.md), or using **Yeoman**. Theoretically, all of them are providing the same stuff, but the **app generator will perform supplementary checks and tests**, making the delivery **100% stable**.

**Note:** `The generator can be used by developers, without an account.`

* Access the [app generator](https://appseed.us/app-generator) page
* Select the frontend engine. You can choose from **Vue.js** and **React**
* Select the preferred backend. You can choose from **Express**, **Laravel,** and **Flask**
* **Confirm**. After performing a few tests the **deliverables** \(backend.zip, frontend.zip\) are sent to your email address.
