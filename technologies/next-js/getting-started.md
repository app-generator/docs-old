# Getting Started

**Next.js** is a React framework that provides features such as rich User Experience, great performance, and faster feature development.&#x20;

The main difference with React lies in the way they handle the UI refresh and rendering. Next.js is fast because of the static destinations, server-side rendering and the way it handles image optimization. This fact leads to one of the main advantages of Next.js over React is that Next.js allows you to develop SEO-friendly static websites.

### âœ¨ Starting a Next.js project

If you have NPM installed, you can start a new Next project with the following command:&#x20;

```
npx create-next-app you-app
```

`create-next-app` is a little bit similar to Create React App, but it's actually for Next.js projects. Once the project is created, you can run the project using the following command `yarn dev`. The project will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### âœ¨ Next.js project structure

The structure of a Next.js project is very simple and straightforward.&#x20;

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ api
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ hello.js
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ _app.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ vercel.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ styles
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Home.module.css
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

In a `Next.js` project, you can find:

* `next.config.js` file containing all configurations related to the Next.js project. It is used for running the `Next.js` server and for build phases.
* `pages` is a folder containing pages that **Next.js** will serve but it also serves a core feature of **Next.js** which is routing. In fact, each page is associated with a route based on the file name. In the current case, you can find the `hello.js` page at `/api/hello`.&#x20;
* `styles` is a folder that contains the styles used in the project.&#x20;

With the basics of a Next.js project understood, we can move now to a simple project we will build in the next pages.
