# Getting Started

### What is Supabase?

Supabase can simply be defined as an alternative to Firebase. Diving deeper, Supabase provides core services such as database, authentication, file storage, and autogenerated APIs. It is very useful for frontend developers or mobile developers are you can have a simple functional backend in less than 10 minutes. In this article, we will see how to integrate Supabase into a Next.js application. You can read more about the Next.js project [here](https://docs.appseed.us/technologies/next-js). However, if you are in hurry feel free to clone and set up the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/app-generator/sample-next-js-getting-started.git
```

Then create a new branch called `supabase`.

```bash
git checkout -b supabase
```

The project serves some products but it's actually retrieving the data from a json file. We will use `supabase` to fetch the products information. Let's start by retrieving API keys and creating a `Product` table in the Supabase dashboard.

### Supabase setup

Make sure to have an account created at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). When the account is created and verified, you can create a new project.

Then, enter the necessary information to create the project.

After that, you will have access to options on the Dashboard. We need to create a new table and insert data. We will do this directly in the SQL editor.

![Clicking on SQL editor](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1661551294621/wmRIa48v9.png)

Here's the SQL script.

```sql
create table "Product" (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text,
  image text,
  price bigint
);

insert into "Product"
  (name, price, image)
values
  (
    'Syrup - Chocolate',
    1,
    'https://iambaker.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/syrup-fb.jpg'
  ),
  (
    'Cookies Oatmeal Raisin',
    5,
    'https://i0.wp.com/www.livewellbakeoften.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Oatmeal-Raisin-Cookies-9.jpg'
  ),
  (
    'Longos - Grilled Chicken With',
    10,
    'https://i0.wp.com/www.themodernnonna.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Easiest-2-Ingredient-Baked-Chicken.jpeg'
  ),
  (
    'Dried Figs',
    4,
    'https://www.bottegadicalabria.com/media/magefan_blog/Fichi_secchi_1200X800.jpg'
  ),
  (
    'Stock - Veal, White',
    40,
    'https://images.ctfassets.net/3s5io6mnxfqz/VEXn1Oiog0DgbUNU79cja/7016c63c031ee03abfb57548c5c10af4/AdobeStock_214296869.jpeg'
  );
```

Now you will have a ready-to-use Table with data we can fetch.

#### Configuring supabase client

Weâ€™ll need to install the Supabase client package to connect to our Next.js app later. We can do so by running the following command.

```bash
yarn add @supabase/supabase-js
```

After that, create a new file in the project root called `supabaseClient.js`.

```js
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

We are using environment variables so we need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project.

> To avoid unexpected behaviors, keep the `.env` file and the `supabaseClient.js` in the same directory.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

You can find the keys on the project page.

![Supabase keys](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1661552218197/CNfdaHPA9.png)

Let's fetch the product list from Supabase now.

#### Fetching data from the Supabase backend

In the `pages/index.js` file, add an asynchronous function to fetch data from supabase.

```js
...
import { supabase } from "../supabaseClient";

const getProducts = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from("Product").select("*");

  return data;
};
...
```

The supabase client provides functions and methods to fetch data from a Table in the most intuitive way possible. Remove this line from the imports to avoid conflicts.

```js
import getProducts from "./api/products"; // remove
```

Start the dev server and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Conclusion

In this document, we made a quick introduction to Supabase by learning how to set up a project, create a table and fetch data. In the next steps, we will dive into authentication and more complex CRUD operations using `Next.js` and Supabase.
