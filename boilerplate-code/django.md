* [Product page](https://appseed.us/boilerplate-code/django-boilerplate) - Hosted on AppSeed
* Samples: [Django Apps](https://appseed.us/apps/django/) section on AppSeed

> [Support](https://appseed.us/support) (Email and LIVE on Discord) for `registered users`.

<br />

## âœ¨ Environment

To use the stater, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is properly installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. The full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

* [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
* Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
* Optional `Docker`

<br />

## âœ¨ Start the app in Docker

> **Step 1** - Download the code from the GH repository (using `GIT`) 

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/boilerplate-code-django.git
$ cd boilerplate-code-django
```

> **Step 2** - Edit `.env` and set `DEBUG=True`. This will activate the `SQLite` persistance. 

```txt
DEBUG=True
```

> **Step 3** - Start the APP in `Docker`

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build 
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

<br />

## âœ¨ Set up the MySql Database

**Note:** Make sure your Mysql server is properly installed and accessible. 

> **Step 1** - Create the MySql Database to be used by the app

- `Create a new MySql` database
- `Create a new user` and assign full privilegies (read/write)

<br />

> **Step 2** - Edit the `.env` to match your MySql DB credentials. Make sure `DB_ENGINE` is set to `mysql`.

- `DB_ENGINE`  : `mysql` 
- `DB_NAME`    : default value = `appseed_db`
- `DB_HOST`    : default value = `localhost`
- `DB_PORT`    : default value = `3306`
- `DB_USERNAME`: default value = `appseed_db_usr`
- `DB_PASS`    : default value = `pass`

<br />

Here is a sample:  

```txt
# .env sample

DEBUG=False                   # False enables the MySql Persistence

DB_ENGINE=mysql               # Database Driver
DB_NAME=appseed_flask         # Database Name
DB_USERNAME=appseed_flask_usr # Database User
DB_PASS=STRONG_PASS_HERE      # Password 
DB_HOST=localhost             # Database HOST, default is localhost 
DB_PORT=3306                  # MySql port, default = 3306 
```

<br />

## âœ¨ How to use it

> Download the code 

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/boilerplate-code-django.git
$ cd boilerplate-code-django
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS` 

> Install modules via `VENV`  

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Windows` 

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows) 

```
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 

### ðŸ‘‰ Create Users

By default, the app redirects guest users to authenticate. In order to access the private pages, follow this set up: 

- Start the app via `python manage.py runserver`
- Access the `registration` page and create a new user:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/`
- Access the `sign in` page and authenticate
  - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/`

<br />

## âœ¨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/                               # Implements app configuration
   |    |-- settings.py                    # Defines Global Settings
   |    |-- wsgi.py                        # Start the app in production

## âœ¨ Application Bootstrap Flow

The entry point of the project is the `core.settings.py` file where all the project configuration is bundled. 
The `most important files` that make the project functional are listed below:

- `manage.py` (saved in the root of the project) loads `core/settings.py`
- `core/settings.py`:
  - Loads the `.env` file (dynamic configuration)
  - Loads the project routing:
    - `core.urls.py` 
  - Defines the `templates` directory
    - `apps/templates`  
  - Defines the `INSTALLED_APPS` section
    - `apps.home` - custom app that serve all pages 
  - If the `DB_ENGINE` variable is not present in the environment 
    - `SQLite` persistence is used
  - If the `DB_ENGINE` is present
    - The DB URI is built dynamically for MySql or PostgreSQL. 

 <br />

## âœ¨ Project Routing

The core file that bundles together all routing rules is `core/urls.py`. 

The `home` application being a generic router that serve all pages defined in the `templates/home` directory, should be the last rule defined in the `urlpatterns`. 

> NOTE: all new apps, should be included above `apps.home.urls` generic rule. 


```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),          # Django admin route
    path("", include("apps.authentication.urls")), # Auth routes - login / register

    # ADD NEW Routes HERE

    # Leave `Home.Urls` as last the last line
    path("", include("apps.home.urls"))
]
```

<br />

## âœ¨ Default Apps

The codebase comes with two simple apps that handle the authentication and serve all pages saved in the `apps/templates/home` directory. 

### ðŸ‘‰ Authentication App

This default app defined in `apps/authentication` handles the authentication routes `login`, `register`. 
The most important files that makes the authentication usable, are listed below: 

- `forms.py` - defines the Login, Registration forms
- `views.py` - implements the login, registration flow 
- `routes.py` - map routing rules over the views 
- `models.py` - EMPTY file 
  - The extended user model is NOT provided 

### ðŸ‘‰ Home App

This app returns all pages saved in the `templates/home` directory to authenticated users. 
In case a page is not found, a generic page is returned using a `404` HTTP error status.
