### What is [AppSeed](https://appseed.us/)

[AppSeed](https://appseed.us/) is a platform that uses automation tools to generate _production-ready seed projects_ enhanced with basic modules, authentication, database, and deployment scripts on top of modern UI kits provided by our amazing partners: [Creative-Tim](https://appseed.us/agency/creative-tim), [CodedThemes](https://appseed.us/agency/codedthemes), [Themesberg](https://appseed.us/agency/themesberg), and other well-known [agencies](https://appseed.us/agency).

Such projects can be used in many contexts by developers and designers:

* Start a new project and code specific features on top of the existing codebase
* Extract and integrate the UI files into a legacy project
* Beginners can use the codebase for learning purposes 

Starters are provided in different patterns and technologies under permissive \(MIT, LGPL\) or commercial licenses:

* [Open-source dashboards](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/open-source) generated in [Flask](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/flask) and [Django](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/django)
* [Static sites](https://appseed.us/static-site) provided on top of 11ty and other popular SSGs. 
* [Web Apps](https://appseed.us/django) used for simple presentation projects for [Flask](https://appseed.us/apps/flask-apps) and [Django](https://appseed.us/django) 
* Full-Stack applications that use [Vue](https://appseed.us/apps/vuejs) and [React](https://appseed.us/apps/react) as frontend engines.
