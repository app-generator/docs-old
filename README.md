## ✨ What is [AppSeed](https://appseed.us)

AppSeed is a platform that uses automation tools to generate _production-ready seed projects_ enhanced with basic modules, authentication, database, and deployment scripts on top of modern UI kits provided by our amazing partners: [Creative-Tim](https://appseed.us/agency/creative-tim/), [CodedThemes](https://appseed.us/agency/codedthemes/), [Themesberg](https://appseed.us/agency/themesberg/), and other well-known [agencies](https://appseed.us/agency/).

Such projects can be used in many contexts by developers and designers:

* Start a new project and code specific features on top of the existing codebase
* Extract and integrate the UI files into a legacy project
* Beginners can use the codebase for learning purposes

Starters are provided in different patterns and technologies under permissive (MIT, LGPL) or commercial licenses:

* [Open-source dashboards](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/open-source/) generated in [Flask](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/flask/) and [Django](https://appseed.us/admin-dashboards/django/)
* [Web Apps](https://appseed.us/apps/) powered by [Flask](https://appseed.us/apps/flask/), and [Django](https://appseed.us/apps/django/)
