### 

### What is Flask

**Flask** is a lightweight [WSGI](https://github.com/app-generator/docs/tree/2d3c04f4ed5d5acb419403f9daf8099709339734/what-is/wsgi/README.md) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. Classified as a microframework, Flask is written in Python and it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
