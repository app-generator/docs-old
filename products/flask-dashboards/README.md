### Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners (and not only) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

* UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
* Render engine: Jinja2 (Flask native engine)&#x20;
* DBMS: SQLite, PostgreSQL (production)
* DB Tools: SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask-Migrate (schema migrations)
* Modular design with **Blueprints**
* Session-Based authentication (via **flask\_login**), Forms validation
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn / Nginx, HEROKU&#x20;
