# Flask Dashboards

All products listed on this page are generated on top of a simple [Flask Codebase](../../boilerplate-code/flask-dashboard.md) enhanced with authentication, database, ORM, modular structure (Blueprints), and deployment scripts.

> Products

* [Flask Boilerplate Code](../../boilerplate-code/flask-dashboard.md) - the reference code used for all Flask Dashboards
* [Flask Datta Able](datta-able.md) - open-source Flask starter

### Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners (and not only) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

* UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
* Render engine: Jinja2 (Flask native engine)
* DBMS: SQLite, PostgreSQL (production)
* DB Tools: SQLAlchemy ORM, Flask-Migrate (schema migrations)
* Modular design with **Blueprints**
* Session-Based authentication (via **flask\_login**), Forms validation
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn / Nginx, HEROKU
