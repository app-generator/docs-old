# Jinja Templates

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment.

**Jinja** is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response. For those who have not been exposed to a templating language before, such languages essentially contain variables as well as some programming logic, which when evaluated \(or rendered into HTML\) are replaced with actual values.

Jinja Templates provided by AppSeed are basically super simple Flask projects without database, ORM or other hard dependencies. We provide this kind of products for two reasons:

* **Jinja** can be used by many Python-based frameworks: Flask, Django, Bottle .. etc.
* **Jinja** is quite similar to other popular engines like Ejs, Liquid. 

On top of this, **Jinja** is the intermediate format used by AppSeed to convert the UI Kits to other engines and frameworks.
