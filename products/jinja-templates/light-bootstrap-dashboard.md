### What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.
