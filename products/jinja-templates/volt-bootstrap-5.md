# Jinja Volt Bootstrap 5

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **Volt Dashboard** (free version),  a popular design crafted by [Themesberg](../../content/partners/themesberg.md). The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the **Jinja** files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine (Flask, Bottle, Django). 

> Features:

* Codebase: [Jinja Starter](../../boilerplate-code/boilerplate-jinja.md)
* Render Engine: Flask / **Jinja2**
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU

> Links

* [Jinja Volt Dashboard](https://github.com/app-generator/jinja-volt-dashboard) - source code
* [Jinja Volt Dashboard](https://jinja-volt-dashboard.appseed-srv1.com/) - LIVE deployment

> [Support](https://appseed.us/support) (Email and LIVE on Discord) for **registered** [**AppSeed**](https://appseed.us/) **users**.


## What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.
