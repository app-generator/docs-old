# Jinja Datta Able PRO

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **Datta Able PRO.** The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the Jinja files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine (Flask, Bottle, Django).

Datta Able is the most stylish Bootstrap 4 Admin Template compare to all other Bootstrap admin templates. It comes with high feature-rich pages and components with fully developer-centric code.

### What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.&#x20;
