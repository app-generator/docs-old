# Jinja AdminLTE

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **AdminLTE**,  the iconic dashboard template. The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the Jinja files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine \(Flask, Bottle, Django\). 

> Features:

* Codebase: [Jinja Starter](../../boilerplate-code/boilerplate-jinja.md)  
* Render Engine: Flask / **Jinja2**
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU

### What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.

### AdminLTE - UI Kit

**AdminLTE** is a popular open-source template for admin dashboards and control panels. It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the Bootstrap CSS framework. It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. AdminLTE is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon.
