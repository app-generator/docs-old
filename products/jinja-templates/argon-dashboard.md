# Jinja Argon Dashboard

**Jinja Template** project generated by AppSeed on top of **Argon Dashboard **(free version),  a popular design crafted by Creative-Tim. The project is a super simple Flask project WITHOUT database, ORM, or any other hard dependency. The starter can be used as a codebase for a future project or to migrate the **Jinja** files and assets to a legacy Python-based project that uses Jinja as the template engine (Flask, Bottle, Django).  

> Features: 

* Codebase: [Jinja Starter](../../boilerplate-code/boilerplate-jinja.md)
* Render Engine: Flask / **Jinja2**
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx, HEROKU

> Links

### What is Jinja

[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modeled after Djangoâ€™s templates. It is fast, widely used, and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment. Jinja is basically an engine used to generate HTML or XML returned to the user via an HTTP response.
