## Improved Authentication 

The codebase has been update to support some new features: 

- Automatic user suspension on consecutive failed logins
  - Limit saved in `configuration` 
  - `Password strength` indicator (registration page)



## FTP Storage

The feature is activated via the `.env` settings. Sample configuration: 

```env
FTP_UPLOAD=True
upload_cloud_type=storages.backends.ftp.FTPStorage
ftp_username   = <FTP_USER>
ftp_password   = <FTP_PASS>
ftp_server_url = <FTP_SERVER_IP>
ftp_port       = <FTP_SERVER_PORT>
upload_url     = <WWW_ROOT_FOR_IMAGES>
```  



## Extended User Profile

- Users are able to edit their profile:
  - Full Name, address, phone number and ZIP Code
- Upload their profile image
  - If the `FTP_UPLOAD` feature is active



## Users Management

> Note: Feature reserved for `superusers`

- List all users
- Edit the information
- Suspend/unsuspend the users
