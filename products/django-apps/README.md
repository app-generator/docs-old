# Django Apps

All products listed on this page are generated on top of a simple [Django Codebase](../../boilerplate-code/django.md) enhanced with authentication, database, ORM, and deployment scripts.&#x20;

> Products

* [Django Boilerplate Code](../../boilerplate-code/django-dashboard.md) - the reference code used for all Flask Apps
* [Django Pixel Lite](pixel-lite.md) - open-source product



### Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners (and not only) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

* UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
* SQLite Database, Django Native ORM
* Session-Based Authentication, Forms validation
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx
