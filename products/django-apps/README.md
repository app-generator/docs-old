# Django Apps

All products listed on this page are generated on top of a simple [Django Codebase](../../boilerplate-code/django.md) enhanced with authentication, database, ORM, and deployment scripts. 

> Products

* Django Boilerplate Code - the reference code used for all Flask Apps
* Django Pixel Lite - open-source product



### Codebase Features

The codebase is fairly simple and was provided like this intentionally to help beginners \(and not only\) start faster a new Flask project. Here is the list with all features already implemented:

* UI Ready - the design is already `production-ready`
* SQLite Database, Django Native ORM
* Session-Based Authentication, Forms validation
* Deployment scripts: Docker, Gunicorn/Nginx
