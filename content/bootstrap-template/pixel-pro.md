**1000+ Components -** Our components are a perfect extension of Bootstrap 4 so you will find it very easy to work with our code if you're familiar with their class names and styles. Furthermore, we've made sure to that all components are well documented.

**35 Example Pages -** These are the last building blocks to build an awesome website. We made sure to offer you a few example pages to prove how useful and great our UI Kit is. You'll find landing pages for app presentations, to showcase your freelancer profile and even a cryptocurrency-themed page.

**50+ Sections -** Sections are made up of components. These are the big boys and they include the navigation bars, footers, about sections, contact sections and many more. We believe that our navigation bars are one of the most customizable ones out there. You can change the whole color scheme just by changing a letter amongst the classes.
