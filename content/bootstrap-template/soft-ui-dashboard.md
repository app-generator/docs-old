### How to use the code

To compile and start the project in a local environment a [minimum programming kit](../tutorials/minimal-programming-kit.md) must be installed and accessible via the terminal:

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version 10.x or above
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - a smart package manager for Node
* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - versioning command-line tool
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - toolkit automation 

Once we have all these tools installed and accessible via the terminal, we can move forward to clone the sources from the public repository, install modules and start the app in the browser.

> **Step \#1** - Clone sources

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/creativetimofficial/soft-ui-dashboard.git
$ cd soft-ui-dashboard
```

> Step \#2 - Install modules \(this operation might take a while\)

```bash
$ yarn 
```

> Step \#3 - Start the app in browser

```bash
$ gulp open-app
```

If all goes well, Soft UI Dashboard should be visible in the browser.
