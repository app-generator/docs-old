# AdminLTE

**AdminLTE** is a popular open-source template for admin dashboards and control panels. It is a responsive HTML template that is based on the Bootstrap CSS framework. 

* [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) - official website
* [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE/tree/v2) - legacy version v2

It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. AdminLTE is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and built upon.
