# What IS Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.&#x20;

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - official website
* [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/) - recommended starting point for every aspire Django developer&#x20;



### Set up PC for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) <a href="#set-up-pc-for-django" id="set-up-pc-for-django"></a>

Being a Python framework, Django requires Python to run. Django is compatible with Python2, Python3 (the recommended version). &#x20;

To get started working with Python3, you’ll need to have access to the Python interpreter (the console, and related tools and libraries). We can accomplish this in several ways:

* Download the installer from the official [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page.
* Use a package manager like yum, apt on Linux systems
* Homebrew for MacOS users.
* Build Python from sources, a method used by super-geeks.

###

#### Install Python on Windows

To install Python on our windows workstation, a few simple steps should be followed:

* Navigate to the official [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page, using a web browser
* Select the installer that matches the OS (32b or 64b)
* Execute the installer (using the default options, should be enough in most of the cases)
* Test the installation by typing `python --version` in a terminal

###

#### Install Python on Linux

There is a very good chance your Linux distribution has Python installed already, but it probably won’t be the latest version, and it may be Python 2 instead of Python3. To check the installed versions, just type:

```
$ python --version
$ python3 --version
```

###

#### Install on CentOS

To install, you should first update your system with the `yum` package manager:

```
$ sudo yum install python36u
$ sudo yum install python36u-pip
```

If you still have issues set up your workstation for Python, feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fZC6hup) server and ask for support.
