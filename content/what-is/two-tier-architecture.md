# Two-Tier Architecture

A **two-tier architecture** is a software architecture in which a presentation layer or interface runs on a client, and a data layer or data structure gets stored on a server. Separating these two components into different locations represents a two-tier architecture, as opposed to a single-tier architecture.

### Sample Apps

* [Material Kit](https://appseed.us/apps/react/express/material-kit-creative-tim) coded in **React** and **Express**, where React implements the presentation layer, and the application login is coded in Express, the popular Node.js Framework.
