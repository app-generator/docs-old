# What IS Static Site

A static website contains Web pages with fixed content. Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to every visitor.\
The term "static" does not mean that your site has no dynamic capabilities. It simply means that that your site consists of a set of "pre-built" files (namely HTML, Js, and CSS files) that are directly served on request.



### Build a Static Site

A static site is usually generated from a variety of sources like Headless CMS, Markdown files, Text files stored on the filesystem. There are many static site generators capable to build, manage and generate static content. We will mention only a few on this page:
