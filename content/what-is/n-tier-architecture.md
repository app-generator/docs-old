# N-Tier Architecture

Multi-tier architecture (often referred to as n-tier architecture) or multilayered architecture is a clientâ€“server architecture in which presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated. Using an N-tier architecture, web developers can create modular applications.

### Common layers

In a multilayered architecture the most common used layers are:

* Presentation layer - the visual part of a web application
* Application layer - the server-side of a web application&#x20;
* Database layer - the persistence layer where information is saved and updated&#x20;

### Presentation layer

This layer handles the user interaction. This part of the application is usually built-in HTML and Javascript in various technologies and frameworks:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - the popular Javascript framework built by Facebook
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)  &#x20;

### Application layer

Represents the server-side of the application and can be developed in many programming languages:

* [Php](https://www.php.net/) (the most popular server-side language ) using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) server-side apps can be developed using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

### Database layer

The majority of web apps requires a type of storage to save the relevant data:

* [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) - the popular open-source database engine&#x20;
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - the lite version of MySql
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a document-based engine



### Common Architectures

In web development the most used architectures are:

### [Single Tier architecture](https://github.com/app-generator/docs/tree/a7c2441bf81cb9d2ad47b81b25204d5fc21897d9/what-is/single-tier-architecture/README.md)

The web application is served only once by the server, and runs entirely on the client-side - read [more](https://github.com/app-generator/docs/tree/a7c2441bf81cb9d2ad47b81b25204d5fc21897d9/what-is/single-tier-architecture/README.md)
