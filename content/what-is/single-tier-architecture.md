# Single-Tier Architecture

Or, One-tier architecture involves putting all of the required components for a software application or technology on a single server or platform. Basically, a one-tier architecture keeps all of the elements of an application, including the interface, middleware, and back-end data, in one place. Some experts describe them as applications that could be installed and run on a single computer.

### Sample Apps

* [JAMstack](https://docs.appseed.us/content/what-is/jamstack) apps where all the code is executed on the client side, in browser: [Fractal](https://appseed.us/apps/jamstack/html5up-fractal), [Landed](https://appseed.us/apps/jamstack/html5up-landed)
* [Single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page\_application) (without a backend server)
