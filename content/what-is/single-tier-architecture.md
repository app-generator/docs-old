# Single-Tier Architecture

Or, One-tier architecture involves putting all of the required components for a software application or technology on a single server or platform. Basically, a one-tier architecture keeps all of the elements of an application, including the interface, middleware, and back-end data, in one place. Some experts describe them as applications that could be installed and run on a single computer.
