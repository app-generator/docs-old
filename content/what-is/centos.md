# What IS CentOS

The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable, and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS Linux is developed by a small but growing team of core developers. In turn, the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, managers, core Linux contributors, and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.&#x20;

CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free, community-supported computing platform functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In January 2014, CentOS announced the official joining with Red Hat while staying independent from RHEL under a new CentOS governing board.
