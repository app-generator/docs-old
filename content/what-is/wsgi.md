# What IS WSGI

**WSGI** is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request. WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in [PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/).



### What is WSGI

In a single sentence, _WSGI is just an interface specification by which the server and application communicate._ This interface used by many popular frameworks like [Flask](https://github.com/app-generator/docs/tree/a7c2441bf81cb9d2ad47b81b25204d5fc21897d9/what-is/flask/README.md) and [Django](https://github.com/app-generator/docs/tree/a7c2441bf81cb9d2ad47b81b25204d5fc21897d9/what-is/django/README.md) is defined in the [PEP 3333](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333) specification for both parties: server and WSGI application.

Python 2.5 and later comes with a WSGI server which will be used in this tutorial. In 2.4 and earlier it can be installed.



### WSGI Frameworks

A short-list with web frameworks with native WSGI support:

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
* [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) - Pyramid is a minimalist web framework aiming at composability and making developers paying only for what they use.
* [Falcon](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) - Falcon is a high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs
