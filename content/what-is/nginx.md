# What IS Nginx

Nginx (pronounced "engine X", /ˌɛndʒɪnˈɛks/ EN-jin-EKS) (stylized as NGINX or NginX) is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of a BSD-like license. A large fraction of web servers uses **NGINX** often as a load balancer.



### Features

* Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers, or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer.
* Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests. Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide more predictable performance under high loads.
* Nginx default configuration file is `nginx.conf`
