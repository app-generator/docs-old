### How to compile DashKit <a id="how-to-compile-dashkit"></a>

Being a commercial product to get access to the source code please access the official page and purchase a license. Once you have the source code downloaded a [minimal programming kit](https://docs.appseed.us/content/tutorials/minimal-programming-kit) should be properly installed and accessible in the terminal.

* A modern editor - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)​
* ​[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - used in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)-based products and tools
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - installed globally 

Once all the tools are installed we can start compiling the code.

> **Step \#1** - Change the directory inside the sources

```text
$ cd dashkit-pro
```

> **Step \#2** - Install modules via NPM or Yarn

```text
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

> Step \#3 - Compile the sources and generate the HTML files

```text
$ gulp dev
$ 
$ # Dashkit is now viewable at: http://localhost:3000
```

 If all goes well, we should see Dashkit PRO running in the browser.
