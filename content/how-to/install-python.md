# Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

To get started working with Python 3, you’ll need to have access to the Python interpreter (the console, and related tools and libraries). We can accomplish this in several ways:

- Download the installer from the official [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page.
- Use a package manager like `yum`, `apt` on Linux systems
- Homebrew for MacOS users.
- Build Python from sources, a method used by super geeks.

<br />

## Install Python on Windows

To install Python on our windows workstation, a few simple steps should be followed:

- Navigate to the official [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page, using a web browser
- Select the installer that matches the OS (32b or 64b)
- Execute the installer (using the default options, should be enough in most of the cases)
- Test the installation by typing `python -v` in a terminal

<br />

## Install Python on Linux

There is a very good chance your Linux distribution has Python installed already, but it probably won’t be the latest version, and it may be Python 2 instead of Python3. To check the installed versions, just type:

```bash
$ python --version
$ python3 --version
```
<br />

### Install on CentOS

To install, you should first update your system with the yum package manager:

```bash
$ sudo yum install python36u
$ sudo yum install python36u-pip
```
