# Install Pyhton 3.8 on Ubuntu

### What is Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.

> Can be used for things like

* Back end (or server-side) web and mobile app development
* Desktop apps and software development
* Processing big data and performing mathematical computations
* Writing system scripts (creating instructions that tell a computer system to “do” something)



### What is Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for the internet of things devices and robots. All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine.



### Install Python3.8 on Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
```

> Optionally, we can add the `disutils`

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3.8-distutils
```

> Test the creation of a Virtual Environment

```bash
$ python3.8 -m venv env
$
$ # Activate the VENV (Unix based systems)
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Activate the VENV (Windows systems)
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
```
