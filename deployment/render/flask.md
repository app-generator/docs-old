# Deploy Flask to Render

This page explains how to go live with a **Flask** project on **Render**, a popular deployment platform. For newcomers, [Render](https://render.com/) supports the deployment for all major languages, Free Certificates, DDoS protection, and auto deploys from GitHub.

### Render Account Creation

The Sign UP is provided via classic Email and Social Authentication for well-known providers like GitHub, GitLab, or Google. Once the sign-up process is finished, the user is redirected to the dashboard.

### Create a new project

All projects that use a dynamic language during runtime (Python, NodeJs) should be created as web services. This option can be found in the navigation bar, as shown below:

### Link GitHub Repository

The next step is to associate a Flask project with the newly created web service. Render support account linkage with external platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. In our demonstration, an open-source repository is used as a working sample.

### The project settings

Before going LIVE, we need to configure the future web service. Here is the information required by Render:

* âœ… The **name of the project** (mandatory)
* âœ… The **root** of the project (leave it blank)
* âœ… **Environment**: for a Flask project, we should select Python
* âœ… **Region**: only if the location of the server is relevant
* âœ… **Source Branch**: the main branch is used
* âœ… **Build Command**: a simple [BASH script](https://github.com/app-generator/sample-flask-stripe/blob/master/build.sh) is used
* âœ… **Start Command**: the entry point, usually managed by [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)

A visual representation of the above settings used to deploy the project can be found below:

**The next step** is to specify the billing plan for the project. **Render** platform, at the moment this material is edited, provides a free plan only for static sites built with **React**, **Vue**, **Next**, and all other frameworks.

The last step in this tutorial is to expand the "Advanced" section and provide a few **Environment variables** required by **Flask** and the Stripe feature.

* âœ… **Debug** Flag: False (the recommended value in production)
* âœ… [SECRET\_KEY](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/config/#SECRET\_KEY) variable: used to sign session secrets
* âœ… **SERVER\_ADDRESS**: Used by Stripe to redirect after a payment
* âœ… **Stripe Secrets:** PRIVATE and PUBLIC keys (provided by Stripe)

An important aspect of the build is the **automatic deployment** that is enabled by default. In this sample, a manual build is used, just to have full control over the deployment flow.

### Trigger Manual Deployment

The LIVE version of the project can be updated and even rollbacked anytime with ease via the UI. Here are the steps required by the LIVE update:

* âœ… Access **Manual Deploy** Option
* âœ… Select Deploy a specific commit
* âœ… Add the commit HASH to be used (provided by Github)
* âœ… Confirm/select the commit
* âœ… Confirm the action and trigger the deploy

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step #1 -** Select Specific Deployment Option

> ðŸ‘‰ **Step #2** - Select the GitHub commit to deploy

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/render-10-create-web-service-trigger-build-commit-id-min.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>Flask Render Deployment - Manual Deploy, Select Commit</p></figcaption></figure>

Once the **Render** platform starts the build, the state of the web service is flagged as "**IN Progress**" and soon the updated version should be LIVE.
