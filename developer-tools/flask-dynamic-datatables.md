### Tool Specs & Status

As mentioned above, the `Dynamic DataTables` tool aims to enable a powerful data table interface on top of any Flask codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

* `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
* `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
* `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic Data Table service over the model
* `Start` the app
* Access the `Dynamic DataTable` provided on op of the model

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic Data Table Service is called books, the associate API is exposed at `/datatb/books/`
