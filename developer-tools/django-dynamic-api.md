# Django Dynamic API

This tool aims to provide a secure, `production-ready API via DRF` (Django REST Framework) using the developer's minimum amount of code. For newcomers, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a leading backend framework used to code from simple websites to complex eCommerce solutions. [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (Django REST Framework) is the most popular library for developing secure API services.&#x20;

### Tool Specs & Status

As mentioned above, the **Dynamic API** tool aims to enable a secured API service on top of any Django codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

* `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
* `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
* `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic API over the model
* `Start the app`
* Access the `Dynamic API Service`&#x20;

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic API is called books, the associate API is exposed at `/api/books/`

A video presentation of this feature can be found on YouTube:&#x20;
